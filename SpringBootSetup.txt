1)Project (Build Tool)
  This decides how your project is built, dependencies are managed, and code is packaged.
    🔹 Gradle – Groovy
          Uses Groovy DSL (build.gradle)
          Older but very popular
          Slightly flexible, less strict
          Good if you follow older tutorials
    🔹 Gradle – Kotlin ✅ (Recommended for new projects)
          Uses Kotlin DSL (build.gradle.kts)
          Type-safe, auto-completion friendly
          Modern & clean
          Preferred in enterprise projects
    🔹 Maven
          Uses XML (pom.xml)
          Very strict and stable
          Most documentation/examples use Maven
          Slightly verbose
    For learning:
          If you want clarity + learning, choose Maven

2)Language
  This is the language used to write your backend code.
    🔹 Java ✅
          Most Spring Boot projects use Java
          Massive learning resources
          Best for placements & interviews
    🔹 Kotlin
          Modern JVM language
          Shorter syntax
          Used in some companies, not all
    🔹 Groovy
          Rare now
          Mostly legacy projects
    For now: Java (no second thought)

3️)Spring Boot Version
    This is the framework version.
    SNAPSHOT  → Experimental, unstable
    3.5.9 / 3.x.x  → Stable & production-ready
    Always choose latest NON-SNAPSHOT version.

4️)Project Metadata
    This defines who you are and what your app is.
    🔹 Group
        Example:
        com.sudharsan
        Like your company or domain name
        Used internally in Java packages

5)Artifact
    demo - Your project name
    Final output file name → demo.jar

6)Name
    demo - Display name
    Usually same as artifact

7)Description
    Human-readable info
    Demo project for Spring Boot
    🔹 Package Name
          com.sudharsan.demo
    Where your Java classes live
    Must follow reverse domain rule

5)Packaging
    This decides how your app is delivered.
    🔹 JAR ✅
        Standalone application
        Embedded Tomcat
        Run using:
            java -jar app.jar
    🔹 WAR
        Used for external servers
        Old style (Tomcat/WebLogic)
    👉 Always choose JAR (modern Spring Boot)

7) Configuration
      This controls how you write settings.
      🔹 Properties
            application.properties
            simple
            Beginner-friendly
      🔹 YAML
            application.yml
            Cleaner structure
            Used in large projects
      👉 Start with Properties

8)Java Version
    Example:
        17 ✅ (Best)
        21 (Too new sometimes)
        8 ❌ (Old)
    👉 Choose Java 17

9) Dependencies
        This decides what your app can do.
        Examples:
            Spring Web → REST APIs
            Spring Data JPA → Database
            Spring Security → Login/Auth
            Thymeleaf → HTML templates
       👉 You add only what you need.

🧠 Simple Mental Model

Think of Spring Boot like building a house:
| Spring Option | Real World           |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Project Tool  | Construction plan    |
| Language      | Building material    |
| Dependencies  | Rooms & furniture    |
| Packaging     | Final house delivery |
| Config        | Wiring & plumbing    |

Questions:

1)So here the build tool concept is similar to the vite concept for react js?
2)The spring boot itself a java framework right, the how kotlin can be used? And what type of language is Groovy?
3)What do you mean by reverse domain rule?
4)And why the package name should be line com.sudharsan.demo
5) What is Group ? And where it is used exactly?
6) So artifact is the project name? Then where does group name is used?
7) Already we have Group name,artifact(project) name then whats this display name?
How many names?
8) So the project name or group name is not the package name? Whats this package name com.sudharsan.demo?
9) What is JAR and apache tom cat?
