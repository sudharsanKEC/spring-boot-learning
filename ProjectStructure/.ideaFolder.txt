spring-boot-demo -> Root directory

  .idea/   ---------------------------> this folder is not part of the spring boot project, it is created by the IntelliJ IDEA, it stores the IDE specific settings not the application logic. The spring boot folder will run perfectly without this folder.
      .gitignore
      compiler.xml
      encodings.xml
      jarRepositories.xml
      misc.xml
      vcs.xml
      workspace.xml

Purpose of .idea
  It saves:
    Project configuration
    Compiler settings
    Encoding rules
    Local workspace state
    Dependency repositories
    Developer-specific preferences
  So next time you open the project, IntelliJ remembers everything.

compiler.xml:
  Controls:
    Java compiler used
    Build output paths
    Annotation processing
  In short:
     How IntelliJ compiles your project.

encoding.xml:
  Defines:
    File character encoding (UTF-8 usually)
  Why important?
    Without proper encoding:
    Special characters break
    Strings may corrupt
  So this file says:
    “Use UTF-8 for all files”

jarRepositories.xml
  Stores:
    Maven repositories
    Remote dependency sources
    Example:
      Maven Central
      Local repo
    Meaning:
      Where IntelliJ downloads your JAR dependencies from.

misc.xml
  Miscellaneous project settings:
    Java SDK version
    Language level
    Framework detection
  Basically:
    General project metadata.

workspace.xml (MOST IMPORTANT)
  This is 100% personal.
  Contains:
    Open tabs
    Window layout
    Breakpoints
    Run configurations
    Cursor positions
  Think of it as:
    Your IDE seating position
  NEVER commit this to Git.
  Each developer has their own.

vcs.xml — what is it?
  vcs.xml stands for:
    Version Control System configuration
    Created by IntelliJ IDEA
  It stores:
    Which VCS is used (usually Git)
    Which folders are mapped to Git
    Root repository path
  In simple words:
    It tells IntelliJ:
      “This project is connected to Git, and here is the repo root.”
  Example purpose:
      If your project has submodules or multiple repos, IntelliJ uses vcs.xml to track them correctly.
Important: This file will be generated only after initializing git in your project.
