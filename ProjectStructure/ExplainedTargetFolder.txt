What is target/?
    target/ is Maven’s build output directory.
    In simple words:
         target/ = compiled + processed result of your project.
    Your source code lives in:
        src/
    Maven transforms that into:
        target/
    Every time you run:
        mvn clean install
    Maven:
      1 Deletes old target/
      2 Recreates it
      3 Places build artifacts inside
    So:
      target/ is auto-generated.
      Never commit it to Git.

Analogy:
    src/      → raw ingredients
    target/   → cooked food

Common structure
      target/
         ├── classes/
         ├── generated-sources/
         ├── generated-test-sources/
         ├── test-classes/
         └── your-app.jar

Lets see what each folder has:

    1) target/classes/
      Contains:
           Compiled MAIN application classes
           Copied resources
      From:
            src/main/java
            src/main/resources
      Converted into:
            .class files
            .properties
            .yml
            static/
            templates/
      This folder is what actually runs when your app starts.
      Spring Boot loads from here.

      Eg:
            UserController.java
        becomes
            UserController.class
        inside target/classes.

    2) target/test-classes/
          Contains:
            👉 Compiled TEST classes
          From:
              src/test/java
          Converted into .class files.
          Used only while running tests.
          Not included in final JAR.

    3️) generated-sources/
        Contains:
              Auto-generated MAIN source code.
        Generated by:
              Annotation processors
              JPA metamodel
              Lombok
              MapStruct
        Examples:
              QClasses
              DTO mappings
              proxies
          These did NOT exist in src/.
          Maven created them.
          Then compiled them into classes.

    4) generated-test-sources/
          Same as above, but for TEST code.
          Auto-generated test helpers.
          Rarely used manually.

Also in target/
      You’ll see:
            yourproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
        This is your final executable Spring Boot JAR.
        Created during package phase.

So, what is target folder?
        The target directory is Maven’s build output folder. 
        It contains compiled main classes in target/classes, compiled test classes in target/test-classes, auto-generated sources, and the final packaged JAR. 
        It’s recreated on every build and should never be committed.
