What is .gitignore file?
    A .gitignore file is a type of file which is created before initializing git in our project.
What is the need for the .gitignore file?
    Whenever we are using version control system in our projects, there will be two categories of folders and files,
      i)  A folder/file that should be tracked by git.
      ii) A folder/file that need not to be tracked by git.
    So in this case, we inlcude all the files and folder inside .gitignore which are need not to be tracked.
For example, folders/files that belongs to auto-generated, machine-specific, IDE-specific, Sensitive files(password) and build outputs and also .class files are not supposed to be tracked.
So we should include all the files and folders in this .gitignore file.

Note: The .gitignore file should be created and the unnecessary untracked files should be included before initializing git in our project.

Rules:
    1) .gitignore will only affects untracked files
        If something is already commited and tracked by vcs then just adding that file in .gitignore will not make that file ignored by vcs.
      So, in this case you must run this command [ git rm --cached filename ] to make that commited file untracked by the git VCS.
      Explanation of the command: git rm --cached filename
                                  git rm means removing the file
                                  --cached means staging area
                                  git rm --cached filename means remove sthe file from staging are and keep it untracked always. The -- before cached means removes from git tracking but keeps file in folder(local folder).

     2)Where .gitignore works
          You can have:
              One root .gitignore - it is global
              Multiple nested .gitignore - it is local to that specific folder.
          Each applies to its own folder scope.

Syntax to be followed in the .gitignore file

1) Ignore a single file
            secret.txt
        This ignores all files named secret.txt everywhere. Even if its inside folders

2) Ignore a folder
            target/
        Ignores any folder named target anywhere
        Eg: target/ --> ignored
            backend/target/ --> ignored
            frontend/target/ --> ignored
        
3) Ignore everything with extension
            *.log
        The above matches files like,
                app.log,
                error.log,
                debug.log

4) To ignore a specific path
            /target
        Only root target folder.
        Not the target in subfolders
        Eg:     root/target --> ignored
                backend/target --> tracked
        Leading / always mean root only

5) To ignore a specific file inside a folder
        .idea/workspace.xml

6) To ignore all files inside folder but keep folder
            logs/*
        Folder exists, files ignored.
        Git tracks only files, not folders, then why we only need to keep folders?
            Because, you want folder structure present but runtime files need not to be commited.
            Eg: Web apps expect logs/ to exist
                So in this case we should keep folder but ignore contents
        
7) ! Negation
            Use ! to un-ignore.
        Eg: .idea/*
            !.idea/compiler.xml
        Meaning: Ignores everything in .idea
                 Except compiler.xml
        Used in team IntelliJ setup cases.

8) Recursive wildcard
            **/node_modules
        Matches node_modules anywhere at any depth, like:
            node_modules/
            frontend/node_modules/
            backend/api/node_modules/
            src/app/node_modules/
        Note: node_modules/ and **/node_modules doesn't have any practical differences.

9) Comment lines
        # this is a comment line

Important Note:
        Order matters:
            Git reads top -> bottom
            Later rules override earlier ones.
        Eg:
            *.log
            !important.log
        Meaning:
            1️⃣ Ignore ALL .log
            2️⃣ EXCEPT important.log
        So later,
            !important.log --> If git sees this, git decides not to ignore this file
            important.log --> on this line git decides to ignore this file and this line wons because git follows top-bottom approach.
            Later ones will override the earlier ones.

Example for .gitignore file:
        In java and Spring boot, most .gitignore files will have,
                    # Build output
                    target/

                    # IntelliJ
                    .idea/
                    *.iml

                    # Logs    
                    *.log

                    # Environment
                    .env

                    # OS    
                    .DS_Store
                    Thumbs.db

Common mistakes:
        Forgetting trailing slash:
                    target
                The above format will remove both files and folders in the project
                So better: target/
Security notes:
            Never commit these files before sanitization:
                    .env
                    application.properties
                    credentials.json
            
So what is .gitignore file?
        .gitignore is a Git configuration file that specifies which files and directories should be excluded from version control. It’s commonly used to ignore build outputs, IDE configs, logs, and sensitive environment files. It only affects untracked files.

Try using: gitignore.io
