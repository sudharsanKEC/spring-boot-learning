What is .gitignore file?
    A .gitignore file is a type of file which is created before initializing git in our project.
What is the need for the .gitignore file?
    Whenever we are using version control system in our projects, there will be two categories of folders and files,
      i)  A folder/file that should be tracked by git.
      ii) A folder/file that need not to be tracked by git.
    So in this case, we inlcude all the files and folder inside .gitignore which are need not to be tracked.
For example, folders/files that belongs to auto-generated, machine-specific, IDE-specific, Sensitive files(password) and build outputs and also .class files are not supposed to be tracked.
So we should include all the files and folders in this .gitignore file.

Note: The .gitignore file should be created and the unnecessary untracked files should be included before initializing git in our project.

Rules:
    1) .gitignore will only affects untracked files
        If something is already commited and tracked by vcs then just adding that file in .gitignore will not make that file ignored by vcs.
      So, in this case you must run this command [ git rm --cached filename ] to make that commited file untracked by the git VCS.
      Explanation of the command: git rm --cached filename
                                  git rm means removing the file
                                  --cached means staging area
                                  git rm --cached filename means remove sthe file from staging are and keep it untracked always. The -- before cached means removes from git tracking but keeps file in folder(local folder).

     2)Where .gitignore works
          You can have:
              One root .gitignore - it is global
              Multiple nested .gitignore - it is local to that specific folder.
          Each applies to its own folder scope.
