What is src/?
      It is the most important folder in our project.
      src stands for source
      It contains:
          Your application code
          Configuration
          Resources
          Tests
      This structure was defined by apache maven convention
      It is called: Standard Maven Project Structure

Typical Spring boot src/ structure
        src/
         ├── main/
         │    ├── java/
         │    └── resources/
         └── test/
              └── java/

src/main/java/
      This is where the actual java code will be coded.
      All the java backend code related to our project will be in this folder
      Eg: src/main/java/com/example/demo/
      This also contains:
              Controllers
              Services
              Repositories
              Entities
              Main Application class
      This is compiled into .class files.
      
src/main/resources/
      This contains:
            application.properties or application.yml
            Static files
            Templates
            SQL files
            JSON configs
      Spring Boot automatically scans this folder.
      Eg:
          resources folder contains:
                application.properties
                static/
                templates/
      Why seperated from java?
          Because: Java files will be compiled 
                   But resources will be copied as-is into final JAR

src/test/java/
      Contains:
            Unit tests
            Integration tests
          Maven runs these during:
                 mvn test
                    or
                 mvn install

Why this structure is important?
        Because Maven expects this exact structure.
        If we break this structure then build may fail.
        Maven lifecycle phases depend on:
                                main/java
                                test/java
What happens internally?
      When you run:
            mvn package
        Maven:
              Compiles main/java
              Compiles test/java
              Runs tests
              Packages compiled classes + resources
              Creates JAR in target/
        Final JAR contains:
              Compiled classes
              resources
              Dependencies(if Spring Boot fat JAR)
        
        A simple analogy:
              Think src/ as the raw ingredients
              target/ is the cooked dish.


So what is the purpose of src folder?
          The src directory follows Maven’s standard structure. 
          It contains application source code under src/main/java, configuration and static resources under src/main/resources, and test code under src/test/java. 
          Maven uses this structure during the build lifecycle.

Note: Every java soruce code file should be in src, always inside src/main/java.
      Never put directly in project root. Otherwise Maven won't compile it.


Spring Boot follows MVC(Model, View, Controller) architecture.
1) Model represents data + business objects
    Usually located in: src/main/java/.../entity  (or) src/main/java/.../model

2) View: This is what the users sees
    Located in: src/main/resources/templates/
    Examples:
        login.html
        home.html
    These HTML files displays model data.
    This is your view

3) Controller
      Handles requests and connects Model + View.
      Located in: src/main/java/.../controller
      Eg:
            @controller
            public class UserController{
            
            }
      Controllers:
          Receive HTTP requests
          Call services
          Send model data to templates
      This is our controller
      
Where does static fit?
        static is not an MVC.
        Its just an asset serving.
        CSS/JS/images support the view.


So, How does Spring Boot MVC map to project structure?
      In Spring Boot MVC, Controllers are Java classes handling requests, Models are entity or DTO classes holding data, and Views are HTML templates placed in src/main/resources/templates. Static resources like CSS and JS are stored under src/main/resources/static.


Important Note: 
    Spring Boot does NOT invent its own project structure because it deliberately builds on the standard defined by Apache Maven (and Gradle).
    Maven is the factory blueprint and Spring Boot is like the machine inside the factory.

Spring Boot relies on Maven or Gradle for build management, so it follows their standard project layout. This ensures compatibility with IDEs, CI pipelines, and tooling, while Spring Boot focuses only on application behavior, not build conventions.
