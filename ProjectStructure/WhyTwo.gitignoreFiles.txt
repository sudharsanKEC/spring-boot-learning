If you observe in the project structure, there will be two .gitignore files.

1) One files inside the .idea folder generated by IntelliJ Idea
2) Another one is in the root directory

project-root/.gitignore
.idea/.gitignore

These two files are intentional and they serve different purposes

project-root/.gitignore  ---> This tells git what not to track in the entire project
                         ---> If the folder name or file name is in this file then it will not be tracked by git.
                         ---> This affects everyone who clones your repo.
                         ---> This is the main professional .gitignore. 


.idea/.gitignore ---> Tells Git what NOT to track INSIDE .idea
                 ---> Because sometimes we want to keep track of some .idea files but not all. 
                 ---> IntelliJ auto generates these workspace.xml,shelf/ 
                 ---> Because the files like workspace.xml is specific to a single persons system environments and so tracking these type of files is unnecessary and so its included in .gitignore.
                Jetbrains add these files, so: Only shared IDE configs stay and personal junk is ignored.

Why not the entire .idea folder should not be ignored?
        There two development styles in SpringBoot on IntelliJ,
            Style1:
                Ignore whole .idea
                          .idea/
                Only root .gitignore is used.

            Style2 (Jetbrains recommended for teams):
                Commit:
                    compiler.xml
                    misc.xml
                    vcs.xml
                Ignore:
                    workspace.xml
                So .idea/.gitignore controls that.
                This allows:
                     Same SDK
                     Same compiler
                     Same repo mapping
                for all teammates.
Therefore: The root .gitignore controls project-wide ignored files, while .idea/.gitignore is IntelliJ-specific and ignores personal IDE files like workspace.xml. This allows sharing common IDE settings while excluding developer-local state

Question: Actually in the global .gitignore, its included that .idea, so the whole .idea files will not be tracked right? So what should I do now? Should I remove .idea from .gitignore?
Answer:
        Current situation: 
                  You have:
                      .gitignore   → contains .idea/
                      .idea/.gitignore
        Meaning:
              Entire .idea folder is ignored.
              So:
                compiler.xml ❌
                misc.xml ❌
                vcs.xml ❌
                workspace.xml ❌
              NONE are tracked.
              Only your code is tracked.
  
        Should you remove .idea from .gitignore?
            No, keep it ignored, especially for right now.
        Why?
          Because, now I am working solo, still not working in a team.
          We are currently in the learning phase, not in a team yet, not sharing IDE configs.
          So the best practice for now is to keep the .idea/ folder ignored.

        We can remove .idea from ignoring, once we are working on a team.

Why ignore .idea?
          Because it contains IDE-specific configuration and personal workspace state. These files don’t affect application runtime and should not be version-controlled unless a team explicitly decides to share IDE settings.
